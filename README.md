# CIFAR10-Image-classification
The repository includes a file ”assignment.py” which first loads the cifar10 data, Second normalization includes rescaling them to the range [0,1]. This involves dividing the pixel values by the maximum value (255). Third convolution neural network model, Baseline 2 VGG Model(Baseline 3 VGG Model can be used to get more accuracy.) is used with max pooling . Then the output is flatten (or unroll) then one or more Dense layers on top. CIFAR has 10 output classes, so a final Dense layer with 10 outputs and a softmax activation. Fourth Evaluation model includes fitting and evaluate, a 10 training epochs for now. This will result in a trace of model on the train dataset and test dataset each epoch evaluation score which is plotted and stored in a file named ”Graphplot.png”. where as the test dataset is used as a validation dataset. Using the above model can give us above 70 percent accuray.
